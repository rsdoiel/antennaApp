<h1 id="build-a-blog-with-antenna-app">Build a Blog with Antenna
App</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-antenna-app">What is Antenna App?</h2>
<p><strong>antenna</strong> is a command line program you can use as a
feed oriented content management system. Historically content management
systems were oriented around a unit of content. In the early web that
was either a web page or block of HTML that was contained in one or more
web pages. <strong>antenna</strong> is a modern static website content
management tool. It is oriented to feeds and also can rendered blog
posts pages.</p>
<p><strong>antenna</strong> takes a different approach to many static
site rendering or publishing systems. It relies on simple Markdown
documents to define a collection, YAML front matter for metadata
curation and a few YAML configuration files. The configuration files are
generated by <strong>antenna</strong> automatically but they are easy to
customized to your needs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-required">What is required?</h2>
<p>You will need a text editor to create and edit Markdown documents and
YAML files. You will need a web browser to review your website. You will
need to install the latest version of Antenna App, See <a
href="https://github.com/rsdoiel/antennaApp/releases"
class="uri">https://github.com/rsdoiel/antennaApp/releases</a>.
Currently Antenna App is experimental, a working proof of concept. It is
expected to evolve over time. Getting the latest release is
recommended.</p>
<p>The Antenna App is available for Raspberry Pi OS, Linux, macOS and
Windows. Find the latest zip file in the releases section of the GitHub
repository and download it. You can unzip it and then copy the
executable to someplace in your path. The program runs from a “terminal”
and is a command line program. The command line is simple and is based
around the idea of an action and parameters needed to complete the
action. See the manual page for details, <a
href="antenna.1.html">antenna</a>.</p>
<p>Install the latest version of **antenna* executable. Check the
installed version</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna -version</code></pre>
<p>You should see a version number and release hash.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-set-it-up">How do I set it up?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a new directory for your project called “blog_demo”</li>
<li>Change into it.</li>
<li>From the directoray run the Antenna init action</li>
<li>Create a collection called “index.md”</li>
<li>Add the “index.md” collection to Antenna</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the steps in a Windows terminal.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>mkdir blog_demo
cd cd blog_demo
antenna init</code></pre>
<p>You need to define at least one collection. In this case the
collection I want you to create is called “index.md”. Collections are
defined by a simple Markdown document. Top level list anchors are
treated as feeds. They are formed like this,
<code>- [FEED_LABEL](FEED_URL "FEED_DESCRIPTION")</code>. If YAML front
matter is included in the document then that data is rendered as Channel
metadata when the RSS 2.0 file is generated. In our simple blog model we
don’t have any feeds to include. Our collection definition can look like
this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">title:</span><span class="co"> My Blog</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu"># My Blog</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Save the above Markdown as “index.md”. You can put any Markdown in
this file. Once you’ve save “index.md” I want to to “add” it to the
Antenna collections using this command.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna add index.md</code></pre>
<p>At this point you can check the directory and you should see several
files.</p>
<dl>
<dt>antenna.yaml</dt>
<dd>
This is the main configuration for the antenna project.
</dd>
<dt>index.yaml</dt>
<dd>
This is a generator configuration for generating index.html form the
index.md collection.
</dd>
<dt>index.db</dt>
<dd>
This is an SQLite3 database with a channels and items table. It forms
the core of the content management tool.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Run <code>antenna generate</code>, this will generate two additional
files.</p>
<dl>
<dt>index.html</dt>
<dd>
This is a collection aggregation page, it’ll be where your posts show up
</dd>
<dt>index.xml</dt>
<dd>
This is an RSS 2.0 feed file of your blog site.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="how-do-i-add-a-post">How do I add a Post?</h2>
<p>Antenna App supports two flavor of posts. Traditionally blog posts
have a landing page containing the contents of the post. On disk they
are organized around a simple nested directory structure where the outer
directory name is the year, inside is a two digit month directory and
inside that is a two digit day directory. The day directory will hold
your blog post.</p>
<p>When making a blog post you must provide some YAML front matter. You
need to include the following fields at a minimum.</p>
<dl>
<dt>pubDate</dt>
<dd>
This is a string holding the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
</dd>
<dt>postPath</dt>
<dd>
This is the path where the HTML file will be written, example
“posts/2025/08/29/mypost.html”.
</dd>
<dt>link</dt>
<dd>
This is the URL the browser will use to read the post.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After this minimal front matter you can write the post in Markdown.
Antenna App will translate that to HTML and include the metadata needed
for generating RSS 2.0 feeds for the “index.md” collection.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a “helloworld.md” post documents.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">title:</span><span class="co"> Hello World!</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">link:</span><span class="co"> http://localhost/posts/2025/08/29/helloworld.html</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">postPath:</span><span class="co"> posts/2025/08/29/helloworld.html</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu"># Hello World!</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This is my first post.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Save this file as “helloworld.md”. Now let’s “post” it using the
antenna command and add it to the “index.md” collection.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna post index.md helloworld.md</code></pre>
<p>When you do this you should see a directory create for
“posts/2025/08/29” and it’ll contain “helloworld.html”. If you need to
update the post you check repeat the command. The link you include int
he front matter is treated as the GUID, the unique identifier for the
post. When you run <code>antenna generate</code> the RSS feed and
aggregation page will be updated to include your new post.</p>
<p>The post front matter includes support for most the item feeds
defined in the RSS 2.0 specification.This is includes fields like title,
description, author.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-add-a-micro-blog-post">How do I add a Micro-blog
Post?</h2>
<p>Micro blogging has become very populate. Micro blog posts are just
short blog posts. Usually they do not have a title. Sometimes you want
to write something in the flow and not generated a landing page with the
commend by itself. Antenna App supports that feature too. The
distinction is that you do not include a title, postPath or link in the
front matter. You just include the pubDate string of when you wnat it to
show up.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple Markdown Microblog post example.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">pubDate:</span><span class="co"> &quot;2025-08-29&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Hi There!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Save this post as “hithere.md”. Then “post” it using the antenna.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna post hithere.md</code></pre>
<h2 id="generate-the-site">Generate the site</h2>
<p>Blog posts HTML are create when you post the Markdown document. The
rest of the site pages are not regenerated yet. To generate the HTML for
the aggregaton page (list of blog posts) and the RSS Feed file you use
the “generate” action.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna generate</code></pre>
<p>You can then “preview” your website using your web browser at
“http://localhost:8000” by run the following command.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna preview</code></pre>
<p>You can press Ctrl-C in the terminal window to end the preview.</p>
