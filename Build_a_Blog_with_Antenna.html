App</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-antenna-app">What is Antenna App?</h2>
<p><strong>antenna</strong> is a command line program you can use as a
feed oriented content management system. Antenna App focus on the
relationship between pages, posts and feeds. Markdown is the common
markup used to curate a list(s) of feeds you’re following. It is used to
provide the content of web pages and posts. This simplifies the work in
curating your website.</p>
<p>Metadata used to curate your posts and feeds is expressed as <a
href="">Front Matter</a> in your Markdown documents. Configuration of
the Antenna App is done through a few YAML files, YAML being the way
markup used in your Markdown’s front matter. The Antenna app uses these
to harvest feeds you are following, aggregate them and render HTML pages
of the aggregations along with the RSS feeds holding the aggregated
content. Similarly if you post your Markdown document into a collection
it Antenna App will use your posts to create an aggregated posts page
and RSS file that others can use to follow you.</p>
<p>By being feed oriented Antenna allows us to create a social web
without relying on a central organization or platform. Focusing on RSS
feeds allows us to have a peer to peer web and slower conversations than
the walled gardens provide. Slow, being helpful, in encouraging more
meaningful discourse than the doom scrolling to X, Meta, Google et
el.</p>
<h2 id="why-markdown-and-front-matter">Why Markdown and Front
Matter?</h2>
<p>Markdown is an easy markup to read, learn and type. Much easier than
HTML used by your web browser. Because it was designed to be transformed
in to HTML’s core features it is easy to rendering the HTML needed by
your web browser. Antenna application provides an easy way to turn a
list of feeds expressed as Markdown into an aggregation of those feeds
expressed both as HTML and RSS. You can think of this is inbound social
content from the web. RSS today is provided by many application as well
as social network. RSS 2.0 unpins podcasting and textcasting. BlueSky
and Mastodon produce RSS output you can follow. Mature content systems
like WordPress also produce RSS feeds you can consume. By focusing on
RSS we take advantage of a wide ecosystem of content ranging from news
websites to personal blogs and micro blogs. Even platforms like
Substack, Medium and friends produce RSS. Many newsletter systems also
produce RSS so you can often started out reading a newsletter in your
email, then switch to their RSS feed when you decide you want to
aggregated into your Antenna website.</p>
<p>Front Matter provides metadata, data about the document. In the case
of your Markdown document defining the feeds you follow the Front matter
provides the metadata used in the resulting RSS feed. This include
information like title of the aggregation, description of the
aggregation. If you are posting to a collection then the front matter in
the post will indicate where in the your website’s directory structure
you want to place the HTML file and use that location when generating
the resulting RSS item. Additionally you can include optional item level
data like a title and modification date or even enclosed content like
the path to an audio or video file if you’re curating a podcast with
Antenna.</p>
<p>Markdown and Front Matter make it easy to</p>
<ul>
<li>read, learn and type than HTML or database languages</li>
<li>generate HTML for posts, pages and aggregations</li>
<li>generate RSS feeds for posts and aggregations</li>
<li>curate a website for your use and if desired to share on the public
web</li>
</ul>
<aside>
While there are plenty of simple markup languages out there Markdown has
become ubiquitous. John Grubber’s Markdown has a nice balance of easy to
read and easy to learn while also easy to type. There are some
extensions to Markdown that have also become nearly ubiquitous and those
extensions have been aggregated into a markup called <a href="">Common
Mark</a>. While Grubber has been be clear about what his Markdown is the
community creating the comment often embraces the features of Common
Mark while referring to their dialect of markup as Markdown. The Antenna
App focuses on Common Mark which is effectively a superset of John
Grubber’s Markdown. But since most people have heard of Markdown and my
not know or make the distinction about the extended features of Common
Mark I will also be talking about Markdown. The Antenna app is a feed
oriented content manage tool for Markdown documents as well as popular
Common Mark features.

<h2 id="why-markdown">Why Markdown</h2>
<p>Markdown is capable of expressing the core features of HTML documents
but is easier to read, learn and type. There are plenty of editors that
you type Markdown. The Markdown document itself is a simple text file.
That means it is likely to be readable decades from now unlike old Word
documents. There are many tools that can convert Markdown to other
formats (e.g. PDF, ePub, Word) such as <a
href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>. That means the Markdown you use
with Antenna isn’t a dead end.</p>
<p>Markdown expresses all the core features of HTML that make the web a
seminal hypertext experience. It supports emphasis, inline source text,
links, lists, paragraphs. Since Antenna App also supports Common Mark
(Markdown plus common extensions) it can even create tables with it or
include images with captions and figures. Markdown does this without
getting bogged down in the XML like semantics of HTML. It is a light
weight markup intended to remain readable as well as easy to type.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-front-matter-and-metadata">What is front matter and
metadata?</h2>
<p>Front matter is term in the Markdown community that refers to
metadata (information about the Markdown document) embedded at the start
of the Markdown document. The Jekyll static site generator used by
GitHub popularized the use of YAML front matter as a means of guiding
rendering of the Markdown documents. Similarly systems like RStudio’s
rMarkdown used YAML front matter to control how RStudio processed the
Markdown document. Antenna application follows in that tradition. It
uses YAML front matter in the generation of the aggregated RSS feeds
from a Markdown document defining a feed collection. It used YAML front
matter to know how to process a post and to enhance the metadata
provided at the item objects of RSS feeds.</p>
<p>The front matter at the beginning of a Markdown document starts with
a first line formed of three dashes, “—”. It continues until it
encounters a matching line of three dashes. Between those Front Matter
is typically expressed as YAML. Here’s an example of front matter
indicating information about the title, author, description, publication
date.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre

<p>YAML is a simple way to express structured data. The data can be
information you would use in a citation or in a bibliographic
record.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-antenna-app">Getting started with Antenna
app</h2>
<p>The Antenna App is a Markdown friendly content system. By to make a
content system that is feed oriented you need more than the document
content typed out in Markdown. A post as an example will need to have a
publication date, it probably uses a structured path
(e.g. “year/month/day”) for organizing content. If you’re creating a
wiki organized around keywords then that path might be structured
differently. In all cases the posts whether blog, wiki or hybrid still
need some level of additional metadata to facilitate automatic linkage
and feed generation. In the Markdown community the concept of a
documents’ <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design#Front_matter">Front
Matter</a> as a means of expressing that. How does that fit with
Markdown?</p>
<p>Front Matter is at the very top of the Markdown document. It starts
with three dash characters, “—” on a line by themselves and ends with a
matching three dashes, “—” on a line by themselves. Anything between the
pair of three dash lines is considered structured data expressed in
YAML, JSON and sometimes TOML. YAML has come to be the most common form
of front matter. What is YAML?</p>
<p>YAML is a simple notation that evolved in response to the challenges
of reading and typing JSON much as Markdown evolved in responses to
challenges of reading HTML and type it. You can find out more about YAML
at <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml.org</a>. In this post I will
illustrate some common metadata as YAML. It is simple enough that you’ll
probably pickup in the same manner that you learn Markdown. See an
example, try it out, then correct things as they come up.</p>
<p>To support feeds the metadata that is most helpful is bibliographic
in nature. It’s includes information like title, description, author,
date create, date modified and date published. Antenna App also includes
postPath to know where to put the posted item in your web tree as HTML
and how to link to the HTML in the generated RSS file.</p>
<p>The nice thing about using the front matter in you Markdown document
for metadata is it is easy to keep up to day when you are writing, can
be used by tools like Antenna App and <a
href="https://flatlake.app">FlatLake</a> to generate HTML or enhance
your website with a JSON service. And can be rendered into the resulting
HTML documents so tools like <a href="https://pagefind.app">PageFind</a>
can provided effective browser side search of your website.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-content-manage">How is content manage</h3>
<p>Antenna app works in a directory where you are managing your web
content. It provides actions used to curate the site. These include the
addition of feed collections that can be rendered as aggregated HTML
files and RSS feeds. It supports posting and unposting content to a
collection (this allows for wikis and blogs). It can also simply be used
to translate a Markdown document into an HTML page using a generative
process described in YAML.</p>
<p>Feeds aggregated into a collection are defined by a Markdown document
containing a list of feeds. The front matter of a collection document is
used to populate the channel level data in an RSS feed. The channel
metadata provides an description of the collection of the feeds being
aggregated.</p>
<p>A collection can be defined without feeds in which it can be curated
simply by posting or unposting Markdown documents.</p>
<p>The Antenna app have a generate command that will take the current
collections and render out their HTML pages and RSS files. It includes a
harvest command to retrieve any feeds that are being aggregated.</p>
<p>Why does Antenna support aggregated feeds? The Web is a
communications platform and aggregation of feeds allows you to create a
social website. One where you expose what you are reading and can
comment on via posting to your aggregated feed. The allows for a peer to
peer(s) relationship to emerge. If I subscribe to your feeds and you to
mine we are “following” one another and can see what we post to our own
feeds.</p>
<p>Unlike systems like BlueSky and Mastodon there is no need for
centralization. Each person’s aggregations and posts works separately
and asynchronously. If you need real time coordination there are many
means to achieve these from old fashioned phone calls, to video chat,
text chat, etc. I believe an asynchronous offline experience can lead to
more meaningful and slower discussions. Slower communication can break
the rage cycle and doom scrolling so prevalent in the walled gardens of
the modern web.</p>
<p>In spite the of much prophesied end of blogging, most news
organizations still produced RSS feeds. This is because most also
provide podcasts and video casts that depend on RSS to exist. Add to
that platforms like WordPress, Mastodon and BlueSky that also produce
RSS feeds and you’ll find there is a rich ecosystem of feed content out
there. Antenna provides you an convenient way to aggregate that into
your own news page. No need to go to Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Instagram
to read news. Just curate your list of feeds in a simple Markdown
document, and run <code>antenna harvest</code> to get the latest. Run
<code>antenna generate</code> followed by <code>antenna preview</code>
and you an read your aggregated feeds in you web browser in the privacy
of your own computer.</p>
<p>Curating your Antenna website then is a mater of choosing to post or
not and updating your list of feeds. You can see an Antenna generated
website at <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna"
class="uri">https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna</a>. I’ve curated lists of
feeds around regions and the blogs. The lists are control by mean and
reflect my interests. If feed becomes bother some I remove it form my
collection. If I discover a new website with a feed I can add it to my
collection. Because the feed is a simple Markdown document it is easy to
read and share. I can even choose to include notes about the feeds in
the Markdown document because it’s just a document and it can be
converted easily into HTML.</p>
<h2
id="antenna-app-knits-together-markdown-documents-front-matter-to-produce-a-website.">Antenna
App knits together Markdown documents, front matter to produce a
website.</h2>
<p>The Antenna application embraces the feed and by that the idea of
“post”. Posts are written in Markdown with meta data about the post
expressed as front matter encoded in YAML. Similarly defining a
collection of feeds to curate is also expressed as a Markdown
document.</p>
<p>The tooling provided by the <strong>antenna</strong> command takes
care of knitting together the Markdown documents defining collections
and Markdown documents hosting posts. The <strong>antenna</strong>
command’s initialization process takes care of create the YAML
configuration files that further define the organization and appearance
of the website leaving you to spend your effort on creating content
using the simple and familiar Markdown text notation.</p>
<h3 id="create-and-curate-your-site-simply">Create and curate your site
simply</h3>
<p>Antenna takes a different approach to many static site rendering or
publishing systems. It relies on simple Markdown documents to define a
collection, YAML front matter for metadata curation and a few YAML
configuration files. The configuration files are generated by
<strong>antenna</strong> automatically but they are easy to customized
to your needs.</p>
<p>If you know how to use a text editor, can pickup Markdown for typing
your content and can edit and modify YAML that contains HTML elements
for laying out the page you’re in luck, <strong>antenna</strong> may
work for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-required">What is required?</h2>
<p>You will need a text editor to create and edit Markdown documents and
YAML files. You will need a web browser to review your website. You will
need to install the latest version of Antenna App, See <a
href="https://github.com/rsdoiel/antennaApp/releases"
class="uri">https://github.com/rsdoiel/antennaApp/releases</a>.
Currently Antenna App is experimental, a working proof of concept. It is
expected to evolve over time. Getting the latest release is
recommended.</p>
<p>The Antenna App is available for Raspberry Pi OS, Linux, macOS and
Windows. Find the latest zip file in the releases section of the GitHub
repository and download it. You can unzip it and then copy the
executable to someplace in your path. The program runs from a “terminal”
and is a command line program. The command line is simple and is based
around the idea of an action and parameters needed to complete the
action. See the manual page for details, <a
href="antenna.1.html">antenna</a>.</p>
<p>Install the latest version of **antenna* executable. Check the
installed version</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna -version</code></pre>
<p>You should see a version number and release hash.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-set-it-up">How do I set it up?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a new directory for your project called “blog_demo”</li>
<li>Change into it.</li>
<li>From the directory run the Antenna init action</li>
<li>Create a collection called “index.md”</li>
<li>Add the “index.md” collection to Antenna</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the steps in a Windows terminal.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>mkdir blog_demo
cd cd blog_demo
antenna init</code></pre>
<p>You need to define at least one collection. In this case the
collection I want you to create is called “index.md”. Collections are
defined by a simple Markdown document. Top level list anchors are
treated as feeds. They are formed like this,
<code>- [FEED_LABEL](FEED_URL "FEED_DESCRIPTION")</code>. If YAML front
matter is included in the document then that data is rendered as Channel
metadata when the RSS 2.0 file is generated. In our simple blog model we
don’t have any feeds to include. Our collection definition can look like
this.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">title:</span><span class="co"> My Blog</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu"># My Blog</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Save the above Markdown as “index.md”. You can put any Markdown in
this file. Once you’ve save “index.md” I want to to “add” it to the
Antenna collections using this command.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna add index.md</code></pre>
<p>At this point you can check the directory and you should see several
files.</p>
<dl>
<dt>antenna.yaml</dt>
<dd>
This is the main configuration for the antenna project.
</dd>
<dt>index.yaml</dt>
<dd>
This is a generator configuration for generating index.html form the
index.md collection.
</dd>
<dt>index.db</dt>
<dd>
This is an SQLite3 database with a channels and items table. It forms
the core of the content management tool.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Run <code>antenna generate</code>, this will generate two additional
files.</p>
<dl>
<dt>index.html</dt>
<dd>
This is a collection aggregation page, it’ll be where your posts show up
</dd>
<dt>index.xml</dt>
<dd>
This is an RSS 2.0 feed file of your blog site.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="how-do-i-add-a-post">How do I add a Post?</h2>
<p>Antenna App supports two flavor of posts. Traditionally blog posts
have a landing page containing the contents of the post. On disk they
are organized around a simple nested directory structure where the outer
directory name is the year, inside is a two digit month directory and
inside that is a two digit day directory. The day directory will hold
your blog post.</p>
<p>When making a blog post you must provide some YAML front matter. You
need to include the following fields at a minimum.</p>
<dl>
<dt>pubDate</dt>
<dd>
This is a string holding the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
</dd>
<dt>postPath</dt>
<dd>
This is the path where the HTML file will be written, example
“posts/2025/08/29/mypost.html”.
</dd>
<dt>link</dt>
<dd>
This is the URL the browser will use to read the post.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After this minimal front matter you can write the post in Markdown.
Antenna App will translate that to HTML and include the metadata needed
for generating RSS 2.0 feeds for the “index.md” collection.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a “helloworld.md” post documents.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">title:</span><span class="co"> Hello World!</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">link:</span><span class="co"> http://localhost/posts/2025/08/29/helloworld.html</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">postPath:</span><span class="co"> posts/2025/08/29/helloworld.html</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu"># Hello World!</span></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This is my first post.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Save this file as “helloworld.md”. Now let’s “post” it using the
antenna command and add it to the “index.md” collection.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna post index.md helloworld.md</code></pre>
<p>When you do this you should see a directory create for
“posts/2025/08/29” and it’ll contain “helloworld.html”. If you need to
update the post you check repeat the command. The link you include int
he front matter is treated as the GUID, the unique identifier for the
post. When you run <code>antenna generate</code> the RSS feed and
aggregation page will be updated to include your new post.</p>
<p>The post front matter includes support for most the item feeds
defined in the RSS 2.0 specification.This is includes fields like title,
description, author.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-add-a-micro-blog-post">How do I add a Micro-blog
Post?</h2>
<p>Micro blogging has become very populate. Micro blog posts are just
short blog posts. Usually they do not have a title. Sometimes you want
to write something in the flow and not generated a landing page with the
commend by itself. Antenna App supports that feature too. The
distinction is that you do not include a title, postPath or link in the
front matter. You just include the pubDate string of when you want it to
show up.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple Markdown Micro blog post example.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>

<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Hi There!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Save this post as “hithere.md”. Then “post” it using the antenna.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna post hithere.md</code></pre>
<h2 id="generate-the-site">Generate the site</h2>
<p>Blog posts HTML are create when you post the Markdown document. The
rest of the site pages are not regenerated yet. To generate the HTML for
the aggregation page (list of blog posts) and the RSS Feed file you use
the “generate” action.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna generate</code></pre>
<p>You can then “preview” your website using your web browser at
“http://localhost:8000” by run the following command.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna preview</code></pre>
<p>You can press Ctrl-C in the terminal window to end the preview.</p>
