<h1 id="curate-concept">Curate Concept</h1>
<p>Curate is the interactive text interface for Antenna App. It is the
default interface designed for novice and casual use. When completed
it’ll include support for all the actions provided in the scriptable
command line interface. It’ll also provide a more fluid means of
managing metadata than hand coded YAML.</p>
<h2 id="origin-idea">Origin idea</h2>
<p>I want an easy way to perform the actions supported by Antenna App
when using the command line isn’t the right choice. Something
interactive but still in the terminal. In an ideal world all the YAML
configuration and front matter would be automatically generated and
editable without having to know YAML. An interactive command could move
the Antenna App in that direction.</p>
<h2 id="the-command">the command</h2>
<p>The command I’m describing is <code>antenna curate</code> or simply
invoking <code>antenna</code> without any options. If an antenna.yaml
file is not in the current working directory you’ll be prompted to
initialize an Antenna managed website in the current directory. If
initialization has already occurred then you’ll be shown a list of
currently defined collections.</p>
<h2 id="curating-collections">Curating collections</h2>
<p>There are several possible actions at the site level. These commands
can be run on all collections or specific ones. It also provides a means
of curating a specific collection. The following actions are planned or
being implemented.</p>
<ul>
<li>initialize a project</li>
<li>list available collections</li>
<li>add a collection</li>
<li>del a collection</li>
<li>harvest all or a single collection</li>
<li>generate HTML, RSS, OPML, Sitemaps for all or a single
collection</li>
<li>curate items in a collection</li>
<li>action recorder (on FILENAME | off)
<ul>
<li>saves the the cli commands representing you interactive actions
taken</li>
<li>generate shell and PowerShell scripts of action sequence with
comments</li>
<li>action player that will execute the shell or PowerShell script
generated</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="curate-items-in-a-collection">Curate items in a collection</h3>
<p>When you enter this menu items are listed. You can review help to see
the implemented actions. The follow actions are either implemented or
planned.</p>
<ul>
<li>list items</li>
<li>set items status
<ul>
<li>to published, review or clear status</li>
</ul></li>
<li>list pages in a collection</li>
<li>render pages in a collection</li>
<li>choose and apply a theme to collection</li>
<li>render posts as HTML</li>
<li>apply the collection’s default SQL filters</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="curate-pages-in-a-collection">Curate pages in a collection</h2>
<ul>
<li>list pages</li>
<li>render pages or page as HTML</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="curate-a-themes">Curate a themes</h2>
<p>TBD</p>
<ul>
<li>list themes</li>
<li>create/add a theme</li>
<li>edit elements in a theme</li>
<li>apply theme to collection</li>
<li>remove theme from collection (e.g. set back to default theme)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="curate-default-and-named-filters">Curate default and named
filters</h2>

<p>I think most writers like to use their favorite writing tool so when
I say “edit” I really meaning envoking a writer’s favorite editor and
passing content to it be edited. Antenna App shouldn’t privide an editor
but should use the one provided by the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>named custom filters</li>
<li>edit collection Markdown front matter</li>
<li>edit collection Markdown text</li>
<li>edit item Markdown front matter</li>
<li>edit item Markdown text</li>
<li>blogit will import a Markdown document, setting up appropriate front
matter</li>
<li>post adds an item to a collection’s feed from a local Markdown
document</li>
<li>unpost removes a local Markdown document from feed</li>
<li>pages lists the pages so you can curate them</li>
<li>posts lists just the post items so you can curate them</li>
<li>antenna.yaml manager, allow easy configuration without knowing
YAML</li>
<li>a tool for create common SQL filters, sort of a Q &amp; A dialog
that results in generate SQLite3 SQL for the collection</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>One of my goals with antenna command line tool is to make the actions
highly scriptable. This is helpful for when your own site finds it
rythem of updates. The terminal interface should map to the command line
version commands such that you can use the interactive interface to
construct a script of actions you can run automatically.</p>
<p>I think the URL should display the command line version of the
comments being presented interactively. This could be used to construct
automations without resorting to direct shell programming.</p>
<p>I was playing with the editor, <a
href="https://aretext.org">aretext</a>, and the way it handles the UI
would be interesting to explore for curate action. Take a closer look at
the find and open method, how it displays files in the current directory
and lets you scroll around it. It uses tcell module for UI. I need to
decide if that’s the direction I want to go with curate action or if I
want something simpler.</p>
