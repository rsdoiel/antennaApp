<h1 id="curate-concept">Curate Concept</h1>
<p>I want an easy way to perform the actions supported by Antenna App
when using the command line isn’t the right choice. Something
interactive but still in the terminal. In an ideal world all the YAML
configuration and front matter would be automatically generated and
editable without having to know YAML. An interactive command could move
the Antenna App in that direction.</p>
<h2 id="the-command">the command</h2>
<p>The command I’m describing is <code>antenna curate</code>. The goal
of the command is to provide an interactive terminal interface for
curating our Antenna App collection(s).</p>
<h3 id="curate-collections">Curate collections</h3>
<p>The bare command <code>antenna curate</code> should display the list
of collections discovered in the current directory. If the directory you
are in does not have an Antenna App configuration file (antenna.yaml),
it will prompt you to initialize the project. Otherwise you are dropped
into the collection level curation options. The following are planned or
being implemented.</p>
<ul>
<li>initialize a project</li>
<li>list available collections</li>
<li>add COLLECTION</li>
<li>del COLLECTION</li>
<li>harvest COLLECTION</li>
<li>generate COLLECTION</li>
<li>curate items in a collection</li>
<li>command history (on FILENAME | off)
<ul>
<li>saves the commands composed into a text file</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="curate-items-in-a-collection">Curate items in a collection</h3>
<p>When you enter this menu items are listed. You can review help to see
the implemented actions. The follow actions are either implemented or
planned.</p>
<ul>
<li>set items to published status</li>
<li>set items to review status</li>
<li>clear items status</li>
<li>page through items</li>
<li>apply the collection’s default SQL filters</li>
<li>if command history is active the commands you execute will be saved
in the command history file</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="curate-a-theme-and-page-elements">Curate a theme and page
elements</h3>
<p>TBD</p>

<p>I think most writers like to use their favorite writing tool so when
I say “edit” I really meaning envoking a writer’s favorite editor and
passing content to it be edited. Antenna App shouldn’t privide an editor
but should use the one provided by the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>edit collection Markdown front matter</li>
<li>edit collection Markdown text</li>
<li>edit item Markdown front matter</li>
<li>edit item Markdown text</li>
<li>blogit will import a Markdown document, setting up appropriate front
matter</li>
<li>post adds an item to a collection’s feed from a local Markdown
document</li>
<li>unpost removes a local Markdown document from feed</li>
<li>pages lists the pages so you can curate them</li>
<li>posts lists just the post items so you can curate them</li>
<li>themes lists the themes available
<ul>
<li>create, add, edit, apply or remove themes from this view</li>
</ul></li>
<li>antenna.yaml manager, allow easy configuration without knowing
YAML</li>
<li>a tool for create common SQL filters, sort of a Q &amp; A dialog
that results in generate SQLite3 SQL for the collection</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>One of my goals with antenna command line tool is to make the actions
highly scriptable. This is helpful for when your own site finds it
rythem of updates. The terminal interface should map to the command line
version commands such that you can use the interactive interface to
construct a script of actions you can run automatically.</p>
<p>I think the URL should display the command line version of the
comments being presented interactively. This could be used to construct
automations without resorting to direct shell programming.</p>
<p>I was playing with the editor, <a
href="https://aretext.org">aretext</a>, and the way it handles the UI
would be interesting to explore for curate action. Take a closer look at
the find and open method, how it displays files in the current directory
and lets you scroll around it. It uses tcell module for UI. I need to
decide if that’s the direction I want to go with curate action or if I
want something simpler.</p>
