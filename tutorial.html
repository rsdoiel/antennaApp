<p>antennaApp provides a simple application supporting feed reading and
link blogging. I based it on my experimental <a
href="https://github.com/rsdoiel/antenna">Antenna</a>. In creating the
antennaApp I hope that others will experiment with their own “Antenna”
and help foster a more open, diverse, web.</p>
<p>The goal of my original Antenna experiment was to have a local news
site based on feeds I could find covering my geographic region. Over the
course of the experiment the number of feeds I followed grew. Eventually
they became collections of feeds. The current experiment is running at
<a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna"
class="uri">https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna</a>. It where I go first
to read things on the web, followed by <a
href="https:/news.scripting.com"
class="uri">https:/news.scripting.com</a> (the site that inspired by
experiment) then to a short list of other sites I enjoy reading.</p>
<p>In the process of creating and running my experiment I noticed I was
avoiding much of the toxic wasteland that is social media today but not
feeling like I was missing out. All it took was a basic understanding of
how the web works, even today.</p>
<p>antennaApp is my attempt to create a simple program to help others do
the same. I’ve attempt to keep the functionality simple but flexible.
You do need to have some know. I presume have a text editor and know how
to install programs on your computer. I assume you can type commands
into your computer’s terminal application. I assume you can lookup how
to create simple Markdown documents if you don’t know Markdown or
CommonMark already. with that knowledge the antennaApp can help you
create your own link blog running on your own computer for your
enjoyment. For those who are more adventuresome and familiar with static
website publicatiojn, antennaApp can be used with that to create public
facing link blogs.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit more detail after you’ve installed antennaApp and can
run it in your terminal.</p>
<p>Step 1, create a text file called “example.md” using the following
Markdown text.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">title:</span><span class="co"> Example of a antennaApp feed file</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu"># Example #1</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This is an example of a feed list expressed as Markdown. All text is ignored except</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>the list below.</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span><span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">R. S. Doiel blog</span><span class="co">](https://rsdoiel.github.io/rss.xml &quot;Robert&#39;s blog RSS feed&quot;)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span><span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Scripting News</span><span class="co">](https://scripting.com/http://scripting.com/rss.xml &quot;Script News RSS feed&quot;)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>(NOTE: It’s actually a fancy Markdown document. It includes some
front matter in YAML. you can get away with just the last two bottom
lines that start with a dash and spaec “-”)</p>
<p>This Markdown document defines two feeds. All the extra text is just
there to show it’s a “normal” Markdown file. As you grow the number of
feeds listed in the document you may find it helpful to keep notes in
the same file. It also gives you an option of including this Markdown
document in your link blog site.</p>
<p>Step 2. Setting up the antennaApp</p>
<p>Setting up a new Antenna is done by using the antennaApp program
called “antenna”. The first time you create a new Antenna site you want
to initialize it. Those is fancy words for “set things up”. In a
terminal type the following command (assumes antennaApp is already
installed).</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna init</code></pre>
<p>This will create a file called “antenna.yaml”. It holds the set up of
your Antenna site. Now we need to “add” the “index.md” that will define
our first collection of feeds.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antennna add index.md</code></pre>
<p>Your Antenna site is ready to recieve content.</p>
<p>Step 3, retrieve the feed content described in your Markdown
file.</p>
<pre><code>antenna update</code></pre>
<p>Step 4, render the website.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna generate</code></pre>
<p>You can preview the website with</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>antenna preview</code></pre>
<p>There you have it, you a minimal link blog on your local machine. In
the terminal window you will see a URL that you can use in your web
browser to see the preview site.</p>
<p>This is just the simple example. You can use antennaApp to add items
to a collection and generate new feeds with it too. antennaApp let’s you
curate both the feeds you read and the feeds you render as a local
website.</p>
<p>The configuration files that are used by antennaApp are rewritten in
a YAML notation. This is the same notation commonly used for “front
matter” in Markdown and CommonMark documents. By customizing the YAML
files you can, with a little knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
fully customize your link blog. You can even integrate other tools like
<a href="https://pagefind.app">PageFind</a> to provide search across you
Link Blog. The content of the antennaApp are staged in a directory
called “htdocs”, this can be used to publish a public website on one of
the many static website hostign services.</p>
<p>The antennaApp also provides an opportuntity to “manage” and curate
the contents of feeds, choosing what is published and what is ignored.
You can use it like a microblog by adding your own Markdown/CommonMark
documents to a localhost feed you manage. It all works because of
Markdown and RSS.</p>
<p>While I publish my antenna to my public site you don’t have to. It is
very useful as a “localhost” website. That is actually how it started.
Eventually I wanted to read it on my phone when I was out and about so I
put it on my public website.</p>
<p>If you can run a command line program, have some knowledge of HTML
and can create and edit documents in CommonMark or Markdown.</p>
