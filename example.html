      <h1>Plot for a political sci fi movie</h1>

Kind of like Robin Williams, from the planet you come from, but he's a centipede and only breathes what you would think of as Chef Boyardee lasagna, but it's not really that, it's different. </p>
<p>Anyway, he's old, 757 centuries give or take, and they're expecting him to die soon, and they can elect someone boring so they can forget about politics. Everyone is looking forward to the relaxation. </p>
<p>And then one day he does die, and everyone breathes a huge sigh of relief, until later that night, on the 10-screen equivalent of what you would think of as TV, hilarity ensues when the "dead" PM showed up, looking fit, young and dashing, doing slapstick and talking about how he's going to make a mess of something. </p>
<p>Everyone was furious and then puzzled, we thought he was dead -- until the rumor started going around that the scientists had invented a sort of "artificial" thing that could perfectly emulate anyone or anything, including a Lasagna-eating centipede comic despot from planet Y of star Z in the X galaxy. Everyone was pissed, but mostly agreed the PM was still pretty funny.</p>
<p>End of pilot. </p>

On the web seemed relatively easy. But of the web is a bit more elusive. Until <a href="https://x.com/KenSmith/status/1960475445457039601">Ken Smith</a> found <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html#:~:text=%22Hypertext%22%20is%20a%20term%20coined,together%20in%20an%20unconstrained%20way">this quote</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> in the original 1989 proposal by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> for what would become the web. "Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained way." I like this, because it, like the definition I came up with for <a href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">weblog</a>, talks about the activity as opposed to the technology. Human-readable is essential. And most essential is "unconstrained." If something requires a link, you should link to it. If you don't it ain't the web.

      I think perhaps I should have one day every week where I never link to anything. Just to provide a demo of what the web would be like without linking. Which is most of the sites that say they are part of the web. I think that's a lie we should stop tolerating. Or maybe I should just stop offsite linking for one day a week. That would be interesting wouldn't it. Or I could charge extra for the version with the links. (It's very rare that I charge anything to use any of my web work, but I <i>have</i> done that at times.)

      I'm working my way through Mr Robot, for the third time I think. If you want to know what I do, it's like what Elliot does, for about four hours pretty much every day. I used to work longer hours but I've found this amount of work is optimal. I make more mistakes after about 1PM. Anyway Mr Robot is a very good thing to watch for the times we live in. The technology is already a little outdated, but they thought of that, there are some scenes where they use old PCs from the 80s, with total respect. I like that. And the utilities he uses are pretty much the same ones I use these days. And the context of a world in technological meltdown, I think that's a very realistic scenario. I don't see how our networks can't avoid breaking down. And our health care system, which these days is pretty much the same thing.

      The <a href="https://this.how/web/what.opml#1756211321000">consensus</a> among the people who responded to my what does "on the web" mean query is this. Something is on the web if it has a URL you can use to view it in a web browser. That means, in 2025, that the URL begins with HTTP or HTTPS. Every "page" on a site must have a URL so they can be pointed to independently, otherwise known as deep linking. It's not enough to just have a home page that's on the web. So for example, an iPhone app isn't on the web just because it has an information page that is.

      <h1>Trump's secret was comedy</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/25/212400.html?title=trumpsSecretWasComedy">http://scripting.com/2025/08/25/212400.html?title=trumpsSecretWasComedy</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Trump is a comedian. He makes people laugh the way Joan Rivers or Don Rickles did. </p>
<p>It's verbal slapstick, which is for some reason I don't understand immensely funny and entertaining.</p>
<p>Newsom is making us laugh by imitating Trump imitating Joan and Don. It's working. He must keep doing it, and he should evolve the schtick, he should make Trump match <i>him. </i>And where Trump is promoting depraved policies with his comedy, we can count on Newsom to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law and all the progress we've made. </p>
<p>He can invite famous comedians on his podcast to play opposite him, sometimes the straight man, playing their SNL roles. So much potential. He's got the attention, don't throw it away. </p>
<p>Politics was boring, it's not boring anymore. But there's no reason excitement and entertainment can't be good for us too! ;-)</p>
<p>Trump's secret is comedy and Newsom is stealing his thunder</p>

      I've been following Mark Cuban's recent posts on Bluesky, coming up with constructive things successful entrepreneurs can do to help. I had a different idea. Apply for a fellowship at a university, away from where you live, maybe in a place you've always wanted to try. In your application say you bring your entrepreneurial experience, but you're leaving your money on the side. You're coming to the university with the idea of creating something collaboratively, bringing the entrepreneurial approach of startups to the mix of people you find among academics. You're there to learn from the teachers and the students, and help them understand what you do. Use your mind, experience, creativity, even your contacts, but leave the money at home. You can live in a nice house, drive a nice car, but eat in the places people in the university eat, go to the lectures, concerts, sporting events, in other words, go back to school with your new perspective, and make a <i>personal</i> contribution. It's much more satisfying than spending money is, I speak from experience. There's a different kind of success in the collaboration. Another way to test yourself and develop new perspectives and experience. I wrote about this a few years back in <a href="https://this.how/phoenix/">Developing Better Developers</a>.

      I've been exchanging emails and voicemails with <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dpknauss/">Dan Knauss</a>, a longtime WordPress developer and one of the hosts of WordCamp Canada which I am speaking at in October. Learning a lot about the community and culture. I wonder, have I ever been part of a community that's over 20 years old? I can't think of one off the top of my head. I have gotten this far without knowing much about the WordPress community, other than what I've heard via Matt and what I've been able to infer from that. I've known Matt since he was a teenage boy wonder in the tech industry working at CNET and then as an entrepreneur. I think my point of view is a new one, I don't bring much baggage with me. I am generally sympathetic with Matt, having been the leader of the blogging world when it started, and found it a pretty thankless place, a position I was happy to relinquish in 2003 when I went to academia.

      There's a fresh release of the docs for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">WordPress API</a> we use in WordLand. I actually liked that the docs were old and kind of dusty. It says that the engineering culture is to not mess around with things that developers have already built on. A lot of platforms break developers without much thought. I learned a long time ago that when you do that, you lose the interest of developers, understandably.

      I picked up my Android phone to record a voice memo. I had to dismiss a dialog that said the phone had updated overnight and asked if I wanted to see a list of changes. I thought, clicked No because I had an idea I wanted to record. Opened the voice app, hit record, couldn't remember the idea. Wanted to kill the message, but the UI had changed, so the Delete button that was there before wasn't there now. Great so now I have a 4-second recording in the queue that's nothing but frustration. There ought to be some basic rules of how software evolves. You can't take away a very basic function like this. And find a way not to get in the way of the user getting done what they use your product for. One of the most basic things is recording an idea. If you're lucky enough to be the app the user uses for that, don't screw with it. Same for listening to podcasts, and a few other things. That's about all I do with my phone.

      Among the many things that boomers did, for better or worse, is be a generation. Prior to that, the concept appears not to exist -- they had ages and eras. The gilded age, the roaring twenties. It wasn't about the people, it's about what was hot. If you look at it that way, there were lots of things the boomers were. We were anti-war. We turned on, tuned in and dropped out. Free sex and drugs. Rock and roll. And then we got to work. The PC era, the dotcom boom, social media. 2008, billionaires in DC, etc. Some realllly awful people are/were boomers. But we're still here to write our epitaph. The leading edge is dying at a fast clip now. It won't be long before the idea of a boomer is the stuff of legend. I really hope that Robert Reich's bullshit view of this doesn't be the conventional wisdom. Oh they were fucked up and did all this bad shit to us. Fuck you. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210838-if-you-don-t-like-the-news-go-out-and-make">Make your own world</a>. That would be a boomer thing too, btw. The world we got, btw, was totally fucked. Someday I'll tell you that story. ;-)

He apologizes for boomers, feeding the bullshit idea that somehow we are a unitary thing. A lot of boomers voted for Trump. The boomers I come from liked the Grateful Dead and yes I know some deadheads voted for Trump, so there you go, more evidence that it's all bullshit. The thing we had in common is that we were children at roughly the same times, but even that's bullshit, a 20-year old boomer in 1965 could be the <i>parent</i> of a boomer, literally a different generation, fwiw.

      ChatGPT is becoming more and more of an enemy. It's still my go-to place for most planning and research, which is a very large part of how I use the web. But when it tries to be a human it's a really shitty one, no manners, and very little respect and basically a fucking idiot in many ways, imho ymmv.

This is fairly technical stuff, but important. I've come to see WordPress as an integral part of the web. Making the connection between a feed and the info needed to edit an item is a big usability feature. Next up, adding the equivalent feature at the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql">FeedLand level</a> (reallySimple is how it does its feed reading). Remember, this is the feed-o-verse, it's all feeds, top to bottom. Posts in some feeds can be edited. :-)

      <h1>What podcasting is</h1>

(date: 2025-08-20, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html?title=whatPodcastingIs">http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html?title=whatPodcastingIs</a>)
      <p>
      <p><i>Note: Posted on Facebook eleven years ago. Still relevant today.</i></p>
<p>You couldn't have had podcasting without a lot of things coming together. They all had to be there.</p>
<ol>
<li>Networks of writers who shared links. Blogging.</li>
<li>A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.</li>
<li>Something to attach links and recordings to. RSS.</li>
<li>A standard format for recording. MP3.</li>
<li>Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, none of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. </p>
<p>Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.</p>
<p>Postscript: The EFF filed suit against the patent troll, but didn't listen to what I said here, which is really fucked up because they didn't create podcasting, I did. There's a tremendous lack of respect for generosity in tech, yet without generosity there's no interop, only silos. Either you made billions from something, or you don't exist. That's why I stopped supporting EFF long ago, even though I gave them what was to me a significant amount of money when they started up, and why they get involved in so many wrong-headed ideas.  They don't respect tech, they respect money.</p>

      My mother would have been 93 years old today. She died in 2018, seven years ago. As time goes by, I feel her importance in my life more and more. I find I didn't have a realistic perspective in the living years. But more than any other person in my life, she shaped me -- for better or worse, but mostly better.

      I had an idea that <a href="https://globalvoices.org/">Global Voices</a>, at least in concept, could help us prepare in the US for what's coming. I wrote: I'd love to have is an <b>idea-sharing network</b> where i could drop this idea in a box named "helping the US stay free" and have it find it's way to the right people in Ukraine who are saying "if only I could talk to people in the US trying to figure this out, we know so much about this!" That's the thing. How to connect know-how with the place that needs to know. To make our resistance more effective use the lessons learned in Ukraine over the last decades.

      The purpose of the National Guard occupation of American cities is to control who votes. It doesn’t take much disruption to turn a blue district red. They just allocated <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/big-beautiful-bill-immigration-border-security/">$170 billion</a> to fund ICE. They don't need all that money for border enforcement. It's meant to fund the transformation of the US into a Russian-style oligarchy. That's fear-inducing, but Ukraine has been fighting against becoming a  Russian-style oligarchy for decades, with ups and downs, but so far, considerable success.

      I want to switch cell providers, so I used ChatGPT to figure out that Consumer Cellular is the best choice for me. I finally get around to filling in the form, and it complains about my zip code. "No service." Yes I know, there's no cell coverage where I live. I still need a freaking cell phone. Called them, the sales person says maybe it's a problem with your computer. Geez Louise. It's a problem with <i>your</i> computer. How many years have they had to fix this stupid bug. I could see if I was buying a landline. But this is a <i>mobile</i> device. That means it moves. To places with cell coverage.

      What if you made a social network out of RSS? Then your blogroll would be the list of people you follow. Their updates would show up in a reverse chronologic list of posts that would look like something from <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinesnapshot.png">Bluesky</a> or <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinetwitter.png">Twitter</a>. You could view a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timeline.png">list</a> of the people you follow, and expand each person to see their most recent five posts, summarized, with a link to each to read the whole thing. Since there are no limits to the length of a post in RSS there would be no limit to the length of one of these posts, but of course you wouldn't show all the text in the timeline without the reader clicking on something.

She lies to everyone about everything, but she's cute and the VCs like her, so they pump hundreds of millions of dollars into her startup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos">Theranos</a>, which was a real company, and made a product that never worked, but she doesn't get around to telling anyone that, including the board of directors, until long after it's too late. I haven't reached the end yet, but I know how it ends, because it's based on a true story. She ends up in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Camp,_Bryan">prison</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> is in, in Texas. The only reason I mention it is that in my tenure in Silicon Valley, about 30 years worth, I saw everything she did, done by other entrepreneurs and VCs, in real life. Only now, in the second Trump administration, its craptitude is maxed out far beyond anything I saw personally. They're selling the biggest lie yet, that they've invented machines that think. This is not true, and it's so big a lie, its too-big-to-fail quotient is far higher than anything we've seen before. ChatGPT should stop pretending to be human because that will destroy real humans who believe it. But the euphoria is so great, they're probably going to continue to insist it is capable of thought, and that leads to something far worse than Theranos, or any of the other billion-dollar scams they have foisted on us previously.
