<h1 id="antenna-app">Antenna App</h1>
<p><strong>antenna</strong> is a command line feed oriented content
management tool. It let’s you create and curate simple websites, micro
blogs, blogs, link blogs, and person news sites using Markdown. It was
inspired by Dave Winer’s <a
href="https://textcasting.org">Textcasting</a> concept, <a
href="https://feedland.org">FeedLand</a> and my own experimental
website, <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna">antenna</a>. The
goal of the Antenna App is to make it easy for writers create web sites
without being required to be web developers or software engineers.
Ideally all you need to know Markdown and that would be enough to create
writer oriented websites you can host publically or privately.</p>
<p>Antenna App’s Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages and posts are written using Markdown</li>
<li>Posts are automatically included in an RSS feed for your site</li>
<li>Aggregations of feeds can be included by providing Markdown list of
links to RSS, Atom and JSON feeds</li>
<li>Pages, posts and aggregations can include metadata expressed as YAML
front matter<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Posts can be added to curated feed collection too</li>
<li>You can have multiple collections of feeds</li>
<li>Collections can be harvested individually or collectively</li>
<li>The managed content is stored in SQLite3 database(s)</li>
<li>HTML, RSS 2.0, OPML and sitemap.xml documents are automatically
generated without additional configuration
<ul>
<li>HTML files are generated for each post, page and aggregation
collection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A preview feature to view the render content in your web browser via
a localhost URL</li>
<li>Site customization is possible through the use of page generators
<ul>
<li>Page generators YAML files describing basic elements of a page,
header, navigation, before/after content section, footer</li>
<li>Custom page generators are composed by apply “themes”</li>
<li>Themes are a directory populated with Markdown files describing each
element of the theme<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>Page generators are implemented as a YAML file, they are used to
frame the Markdown content added a pages and posts</li>
<li>Each collection may contain its own page generator</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Antenna App plays well with other static website tools
(e.g. PageFind)</li>
<li>Antenna App includes an experimental interactive terminal interface
for curating your collections and posts</li>
</ul>
<p>The combined features of Antenna App go beyond most static site
generators. It provides a means of making collaboritive website through
the ability to import feeds from one or more people. You can add your
own Markdown content to a feed allowing for commentary in a specific
feed collection. Feed orientation allows Antenna App sites to be social
without turning over atonomy of our content to another site.</p>
<p>I believe Antenna App is well suited for creating local community
sites where each contributed produces a feed of articles that are then
linked from a common website. This could be used for aggregating content
of special interest groups or for local neighborhood news sites. The
site doing the aggregation can control those feed items to be published
allowing for editorial control. Since this runs on your computer you
don’t need to run specialized services hosted on the public web. You get
the flexibity of a dynamic system with the low overhead and high
availability provided by static websites.</p>
