Installation for development of **antennaApp**
===========================================

**antennaApp** antennaApp provides a simple application that supports [Textcasting](https://textcasting.org) and Link Blogging.
It is built on my experience build my [Antenna](https://github.com/rsdoiel/antenna) personal news aggregator site and my experimental feed reader
project called [Skimmer](https://github.com/rsdoiel/skimmer). It uses the Skimmer project to create a turn key
Antenna style website and curation tool that can run on common computers running Raspberry Pi OS, macOS and Windows.

Quick install with curl or irm
------------------------------

There is an experimental installer.sh script that can be run with the following command to install latest table release. This may work for macOS, Linux and if youâ€™re using Windows with the Unix subsystem. This would be run from your shell (e.g. Terminal on macOS).

~~~shell
curl https://rsdoiel.github.io/antennaApp/installer.sh | sh
~~~

This will install the programs included in antennaApp in your `$HOME/bin` directory.

If you are running Windows 10 or 11 use the Powershell command below.
