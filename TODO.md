## Bugs

- [ ] The RSS I'm producing isn't always valid for aggregated items
- [Xl The link element for RSS feeds isn't showing up in aggregated HTML or post HTML pages

## Up Next

- [X] Double check the ordering of my head element children, make sure the meta element for character encoding comes before title

## Thinking about

- [X] Consider a page action, it would make sure that the metadata is valid like post would be just render the HTML page next to the Markdown document, this could minimize the need to rely on Pandoc
- [ ] Documenting simple to complex integrations, it would be helpful to how how you can integrate Pandoc, PageFind and FlatLake to produce a rich websites using content managed by antennaApp
- [ ] Should antenna init also generate some sample CSS and JavaScript modules for easy integrations with Pandoc, PageFind or FlatLake?
- [ ] To make Antenna app more interesting  I need to include some sample themes other people would use. 
  - I could look over the websites for feeds followed in the Antenna website and see if I could recreate similar styles
  - I could look at the WP theme gallery for ideas and see what could be implemented
- [ ] In the front matter defining a collection, should the link element require full URL or a partial one?
  - full is simpler in rendering implementation but makes previewing and proof reading tricky
  - relative makes previewing and proof reading much easier as the preview becomes functions like published sites
  - the antenna YAML could make a distriction between preview URL (localhost) and published URL (staged for production)
- [ ] Should postPath point at Markdown document or HTML?  The link element is pointing at HTML any
- [ ] Should I allow relative link elements in the post's front matter? this would limit typos of long urls, might handle the preview verus publication issues around full URL versus relative paths.
- [ ] Shouldn't generate handle all HTML/RSS 2.0 rendering?  The post action renders the HTML in the target path, this feels right in the sense it is immediately visible to proof read but when the YAML page definitions are updated you have to "post" the items again to pickup the changes, so this doesn't make sense as the post wasn't really updated in terms of content.
  - As the items are processed, items that have `postPath` set could queued be re-rendered as HTML
- [ ] Think about generator.go and what they are generating, might make sense to split out the HTML and RSS 2.0 generation into separate files and have the wrapping functions or interfaces defined in generator.go
- [ ] Improve default YAML for rendering colllections
  - Nav could be autogenerated for the defined collections in the antenna.yaml
  - header and footer elements could be formed such that customization is easily seen
  - The head element needs work, I could include an example of a style element with sensible generic CSS for correctly sizing H elements, this could go after the automated stuff like setting character encoding correctly before the title element 
- [ ] It'd be nice to have full enclusure support so podcasting using antenna's post worked seemlessly. Need to look at existing Go packages to see what has already be implemented or what might suggest the right path forward
  - [github.com/eduncan911/podcast](https://github.com/eduncan911/podcast)
- [ ] Evaluate how to "post" to specific platforms, e.g. BlueSky and Mastodon since they do not handle inbound RSS yet
  - See [github.com/bitesinbyte/ferret](https://github.com/bitesinbyte/ferret) as an example

## Someday, Maybe

- [ ] A Web GUI for managing collections, feeds and items. Could work like preview action, `antenna manage`
